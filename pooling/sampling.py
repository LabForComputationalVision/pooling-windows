"""functions related to sampling

handful of functions here, related to sampling and checking whether
you're sampling correctly, in order to avoid aliasing

when doing something like strided convolution or using the pooling windows from
plenoptic, you want to make sure you're sampling the image appropriately, in
order to avoid aliasing. this file contains some functions to help you with
that, see the Sampling_and_Aliasing notebook for some examples

    r"""check how sampling relates to interpolation quality

    Given a function, a domain, and how to sample that domain, this
    function will use linear algebra (``np.linalg.lstsq``) to determine
    how to interpolate the function so that it's centered on each
    pixel. You can then use functions like ``plot_coeffs`` and
    ``create_movie`` to see the quality of this interpolation

    The idea here is to take a function (for example,
    ``po.simul.pooling.gaussian``) and say that we have this function
    defined at, e.g., every 10 pixels on the array ``linspace(-5, 5,
    101)``. We want to answer then, the question of how well we can
    interpolate to all the intermediate functions, that is, the
    functions centered on each pixel in the array.

    You can either specify the spacing in pixels (``pix_sampling``) xor
    in x values (``val_sampling``), but exactly one of them must be set.

    Your function can either be a torch or numpy function, but ``x``
    must be the appropriate type, we will not cast it for you.

    Parameters
    ----------
    val_sampling : float or None, optional.
        If float, how far apart (in x-values) each sampled function
        should be. This doesn't have to align perfectly with the pixels,
        but should be close. If None, we use ``pix_sampling`` instead.
    pix_sampling : int or None, optional
        If int, how far apart (in pixels) each sampled function should
        be. If None, we use ``val_sampling`` instead.
    func : callable, optional
        the function to check interpolation for. must take ``x`` as its
        first input, all additional kwargs can be specified in
        ``func_kwargs``
    x : torch.tensor or np.array, optional
        the 1d tensor/array to evaluate ``func`` on.
    func_kwargs :
        additional kwargs to pass to ``func``

    Returns
    -------
    sampled : np.array
        the array of sampled functions. will have shape ``(len(x),
        ceil(len(x)/pix_sampling))``
    full : np.array
        the array of functions centered at each pixel. will have shape
        ``(len(x), len(x))``
    interpolated : np.array
        the array of functions interpolated to each pixel. will have
        shape ``(len(x), len(x))``
    coeffs : np.array
        the array of coefficients to transform ``sampled`` to
        ``full``. This has been transposed from the array returned by
        ``np.linalg.lstsq`` and thus will have the same shape as
        ``sampled`` (this is to make it easier to restrict which coeffs
        to look at, since they'll be more easily indexed along first
        dimension)
    residuals : np.array
        the errors for each interpolation, will have shape ``len(x)``
