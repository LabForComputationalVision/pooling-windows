"""functions to perform spatial pooling, as seen in Freeman and Simoncelli, 2011

In addition the raised-cosine windows used in that paper, we also
provide support for an alternative window construction:
Gaussians. They're laid out in the same fashion as the raised-cosine
windows, but are wider and have values everywhere (whereas the
raised-cosine windows are clipped so that they're zero for most of the
image). Using the raised-cosine windows led to issues with aliasing in
metamer synthesis, visible as ringing, with the PooledV1
model, because of the interactions between the windows and the steerable
pyramid filters.

The Gaussian windows don't have these problems, but require more windows to
evenly tile the image in the radial direction (and thus PoolingWindows.forward
will take more memory and more time). Note as well that, whereas the max
amplitude of the raised-cosine windows is always 1 (for all transition region
widths), the Gaussian windows will have their max amplitude scaled down as
their standard deviation increases; as the standard deviation increases, the
windows overlap more, so that the number of windows a given pixel lies in
increases and thus the weighting in each of them needs to decrease in order to
make sure the sum across all windows is still 1 for every pixel. The Gaussian
windows will always intersect at x=.5, but the interpretation of this depends
on its standard deviation. For Gaussian windows, we recommend (and only
support) a standard deviation of 1, so that each window intersects at half a
standard deviation.

pooling_windows.py contains the PoolingWindows class, which uses most of these
functions

    If scaling is set, ``min_ecc`` and ``max_ecc`` are ignored (the window

    Notes

    No equation was given in the paper to calculate the window spacing,

        t &= \frac{s \pm \sqrt{s^2+4}}{2}

    We then substitute back for :math:`t` and drop the negative root
    because the window spacing is strictly positive.

    Scaling is the ratio of the eccentricity window's radial full-width
    at half-maximum to eccentricity. For eccentricity, we use the
    window's "central eccentricity", the one where the input to the
    mother window (:math:`x` in equation 9 in the online methods) is 0.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_windows : `float`
        The number of log-eccentricity windows we create.

        The standard deviation fo the Gaussian window. If this is set,

        for the cosine ones.

    Returns
    -------
    scaling : `float`.
        The ratio of the eccentricity window's radial full-width at
        half-maximum to eccentricity

    Notes
    -----
    No equation for the scaling, :math:`s`, was included in the paper,
    so we derived this ourselves. To start, we note that the mother
    window equation (equation 9) reaches its half-max (.5) at
    :math:`x=\pm .5`, and that, as above, we treat :math:`x=0` as the
    central eccentricity of the window. Then we must solve for these,
    using the values given within the parentheses in equation 11 as the
    value for :math:`x`, and take their ratios.

    In the following equations, we'll use :math:`x_h` as the value at
    which the window reaches its half-max. For the cosine windows, this
    is always :math:`\pm .5`, but for the Gaussian windows, it's
    :math:`x_h=\sigma\sqrt{2\log 2}`.

    It turns out that this holds for all permissible values of
    ``transition_region_width`` (:math:`t` in the equations) (try
    playing around with some plots if you don't believe me).

    Full-width half-maximum, :math:`W`, the difference between the two
    values of :math:`e_h`:

    .. math::

        \pm x_h &= \frac{\log(e_h) - (log(e_0)+w_e(n+1))}{w_e} \\
        e_h &= e_0 \cdot \exp(w_e(\pm x_h+n+1)) \\
        W &= e_0 (\exp(w_e(n+1+x_h)) - \exp(w_e(n+1-x_h))

    Window's central eccentricity, :math:`e_c`:

    .. math::

        0 &= \frac{\log(e_c) -(log(e_0)+w_e(n+1))}{w_e} \\
        e_c &= e_0 \cdot \exp(w_e(n+1))

    Then the scaling, :math:`s` is the ratio :math:`\frac{W}{e_c}`:

    .. math::

        s &= \frac{e_0 (\exp(w_e(n+1+x_h)) -  \exp(w_e(n+1-x_h)))}{e_0 \cdot \exp(w_e(n+1))} \\
        s &= \frac{\exp(w_e(n+1+x_h))}{\exp(w_e(n+1))} -  \frac{\exp(w_e(n+1-x_h))}{\exp(w_e(n+1))} \\
        s &= \exp(w_e(n+1+x_h-n-1)) -  \exp(w_e(n+1-x_h-n-1)) \\
        s &= \exp(x_h\cdot w_e) -  \exp(-x_h\cdot w_e)

    Note that we don't actually use the value returned by
    ``calc_windows_eccentricity`` for :math:`e_c`; we simplify
    it away in the calculation above.

        The width of the flat-top region of the windows in the radial

    Notes
    -----
    For raised-cosine windows:

    In order to calculate the width in the angular direction, we start
    with the angular window width (:math:`w_{\theta }`). The 'top' width
    is then :math:`w_{\theta}(1-t)` and the 'full' width is
    :math:`w_{\theta}(1+t)`, where :math:`t` is the
    ``transition_region_width``. This gives us the width in radians, so
    we convert it to degrees by finding the windows' central
    eccentricity (:math:`e_c`, as referred to in ``calc_scaling`` and
    returned by ``calc_windows_central_eccentricity``), and find the
    circumference (in degrees) of the circle that goes through that
    eccentricity. We then multiply our width in radians by
    :math:`\frac{2\pi e_c}{2\pi}=e_c`.

    Calculating the width in the radial direction is slightly more
    complicated, because they're not symmetric or constant across the
    visual field. We start by noting, based on equation 9 in the paper,
    that the flat-top region is the region between :math:`x=\frac{\pm
    (1-t)}{2}` and the whole window is the region between
    :math:`x=\frac{\pm (1+t)}{2}`. We can then do a little bit of
    rearranging to forms used in this function.

    For gaussian windows:

    The 'top' width in either direction is 0, because a gaussian has no
    flat top region.

    We consider the 'full' width to be 3 standard deviations out. That
    means that a given window's full extent goes from :math:`x=-3\sigma`
    to :math:`x=3\sigma`, where :math:`\sigma` is ``std_dev``, the
    window's standard deviation, and :math:`x` is the input to the
    ``gaussian`` function (analogous to the ``mother_window`` function).

    In the angular direction, for window :math:`n`,
    :math:`x=\frac{\theta-w_\theta n}{w_\theta}` (see equation 10, and
    we ignore the part of that equation that includes :math:`t`, because
    the gaussian windows have no transition region width). Rearranging,
    we see that the extent of the window in radians is thus :math:`\pm
    3\sigma w_\theta`, so the full width is then :math:`6\sigma w_\theta
    e_c`, where :math:`e_c` is the window's central eccentricity and
    necessary to convert it to degreess.

    We can follow similar logic for the radial direction, knowing that
    we want to find the difference between math:`\exp(\pm 3\sigma w_e +
    \log e_0 + w_e(n+1))` and rearranging to the forms used in this
    function.

    divide half of ``img_res`` by ``max_eccentricity``. However, we want

    want to use is the max of the two numbers in ``img_res`` (this is
    the way we construct the PoolingWindow objects; we want the windows

    img_res : tuple

        integers).
    max_eccentricity : float, optional

    r"""Calculate the eccentricity where window area exceeds a threshold

    The pooling windows are used primarily for metamer synthesis, and
    conceptually, if the pooling windows only include a single pixel, or
    smaller, then the only metamer for that window is exactly that
    pixel. Therefore, we don't need to compute these tiny windows, and
    we don't want to for computational reasons (it will make everything
    take much longer).

    Since ``scaling`` sets the size of the windows at eccentricity, by
    giving the slope between the diameter (in the radial direction) at
    half-max and the eccentricity, we can use it to determine the area
    of the window in each direction. What we calculate here is only an
    approximation and slightly arbitrary. Let :math:`s` be the scaling
    value, then we approximate the area :math:`(s \cdot e \cdot
    \frac{r_{pix}}{r_{deg}})^2 \cdot \frac{\pi}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{r}`,
    where :math:`r` is the ratio between the radial and circumferential
    widths, i.e. the ``radial_to_circumferential_ratio``
    arg. :math:`s\cdot e` is the diameter at half-max in degrees,
    multiplying it by :math:`\frac{r_{pix}}{r_{deg}}` (the radius of the
    image in pixels and degrees, respectively) converts it to pixels,
    and that and multiplying by :math:`\frac{pi}{4}` gives the area of a
    circle with that diameter; multiplying it by :math:`\frac{1}{r}`
    then converts this to a regular oval with this aspect ratio. This is
    a lower-bound on the area of our windows, which are actually
    elongated ovals with a larger radius than this, and thus a bit more
    complicated to compute.

    Note that, since we're using the scaling to figure this out, we're
    computing the area at approximately the windows' full-max
    half-width, and this is what we're doing for both gaussian and
    raised-cosine windows (though gaussian windows technically extend
    further beyond the FWHM than raised-cosine windows, the difference
    is not large for small windows).

    Parameters
    ----------
    scaling : float
        Scaling parameter that governs the size of the pooling
        windows. Other pooling windows parameters
        (``radial_to_circumferential_ratio``,
        ``transition_region_width``) cannot be set here. If that ends up
        being of interest, will change that.
    img_res : tuple
        The resolution of our image (should therefore contains
        integers).
    max_eccentricity : float, optional
        The eccentricity (in degrees) of the edge of the image
    pixel_area_thresh : float, optional
        What area (in square pixels) to check against our approximate
        pooling window area. This is slightly arbitrary, but should be
        consistent
    radial_to_circumferential_ratio : `float`, optional
        ``scaling`` determines the number of log-eccentricity windows we
        can create; this ratio gives us the number of polar angle
        ones. Based on `scaling`, we calculate the width of the windows
        in log-eccentricity, and then divide that by this number to get
        their width in polar angle. Because we require an integer number
        of polar angle windows, we round the resulting number of polar
        angle windows to the nearest integer, so the ratio in the
        generated windows approximate this. 2 (the default) is the value
        used in the paper [1]_.

    Returns
    -------
    min_ecc_deg : float
        The eccentricity (in degrees) where window area will definitely
        exceed ``pixel_area_thresh``

    Possible alternative mother window, giving the weighting in each

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : float or array_like
        The distance in a direction

    Returns
    -------
    array
        The value of the window at each value of `x`

    Notes
    -----
    We normalize in here in order to make sure that the windows sum to
    1. In order to do that, we note that each Gaussian is centered at
    integer x values: 0, 1, 2, 3, etc. If we're summing at ``x=0``, we
    then note that the first window will be centered there and so have
    its max amplitude, its two nearest neighbors will be 1 away from
    their center (these Gaussians are symmetric), their two nearest
    neighbors will be 2 away from their center, etc. Therefore, we'll
    have one Gaussian at max value (1), two at
    :math:`\exp(\frac{-1^2}{2\sigma^2})`, two at
    :math:`\exp(\frac{-2^2}{2\sigma^2})`, etc.

    Summing at this location will give us the value we need to normalize
    by, :math:`S`. We work through this with :math:`\sigma=1`:

    ..math::

        S &= 1 + 2 * \exp(\frac{-(1)^2}{2\sigma^2}) + 2 * \exp(\frac{-(2)^2}{2\sigma^2}) + ...
        S &= 1 + 2 * \sum_{n=1}^{\inf} \exp({-n^2}{2})
        S &= -1 + 2 * \sum_{n=0}^{\inf} \exp({-n^2}{2})

    And we've stored this number as the constant ``GAUSSIAN_SUM`` (the
    infinite sum computed in the equation above was using Wolfram Alpha,
    https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=sum+0+to+inf+e%5E%28-n%5E2%2F2%29+)

    When ``std_dev>1``, the windows overlap more. As with the
    probability density function of a normal distribution, we divide by
    ``std_dev`` to keep the integral constant for different values of
    ``std_dev`` (though the integral is not 1). This means that summing
    across multiple windows will still give us a value of 1.

    r"""Create two sets of 2d pooling windows (log-eccentricity and polar angle) that span the visual field

    This creates the pooling windows that we use to average image
    statistics for metamer generation as done in [1]_. This is returned
    as two 3d torch tensors for further use with a model.

    Note that these are returned separately as log-eccentricity and
    polar angle tensors and if you want the windows used in the paper
    [1]_, you'll need to call ``torch.einsum`` (see Examples section)
    or, better yet, use the ``PoolingWindows`` class, which is provided
    for this purpose.

    Parameters
    ----------
    scaling : `float` or `None`.
        The ratio of the eccentricity window's radial full-width at
        half-maximum to eccentricity (see the `calc_scaling` function).
    resolution : tuple
        2-tuple of ints specifying the resolution of the 2d images to
        make.
    min_eccentricity : `float`, optional
        The minimum eccentricity, the eccentricity below which we do not
        compute pooling windows (in degrees). Parameter :math:`e_0` in
        equation 11 of the online methods.
    max_eccentricity : `float`, optional
        The maximum eccentricity, the outer radius of the image (in
        degrees). Parameter :math:`e_r` in equation 11 of the online
        methods.
    radial_to_circumferential_ratio : `float`, optional
        ``scaling`` determines the number of log-eccentricity windows we
        can create; this ratio gives us the number of polar angle
        ones. Based on `scaling`, we calculate the width of the windows
        in log-eccentricity, and then divide that by this number to get
        their width in polar angle. Because we require an integer number
        of polar angle windows, we round the resulting number of polar
        angle windows to the nearest integer, so the ratio in the
        generated windows approximate this. 2 (the default) is the value
        used in the paper [1]_.
    window_type : {'cosine', 'gaussian'}
        Whether to use the raised cosine function from [1]_ or a Gaussian that
        has approximately the same structure. If cosine,
        ``transition_region_width`` must be set; if gaussian, then ``std_dev``
        must be set.
    transition_region_width : `float` or None, optional
        The width of the transition region, parameter :math:`t` in
        equation 9 from the online methods.
    std_dev : float or None, optional
        The standard deviation of the Gaussian window. WARNING -- if
        this is too small (say < 3/4), then the windows won't tile
        correctly. So we only support std_dev=1 for now.
    device : str or torch.device
        the device to create these tensors on

    Returns
    -------
    angle_windows : torch.Tensor or dict
        The 3d tensor of 2d polar angle windows. Its shape will be
        ``(n_angle_windows, *resolution)``, where the number of windows
        is inferred in this function based on the values of ``scaling``
        and ``radial_to_circumferential_width``.
    ecc_windows : torch.Tensor or dict
        The 3d tensor of 2d log-eccentricity windows. Its shape will be
        ``(n_eccen_windows, *resolution)``, where the number of windows
        is inferred in this function based on the values of ``scaling``,
        ``min_ecc``, and ``max_ecc``.

    Examples
    --------
    To use, simply call with the desired scaling (for the version seen
    in the paper, don't change any of the default arguments; compare
    this image to the right side of Supplementary Figure 1C)

    .. plot::
       :include-source:

       import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
       import plenoptic as po
       import pyrtools as pt
       angle_w, ecc_w = po.simul.pooling.create_pooling_windows(.87, (256, 256))
       fig = po.imshow(ecc_w.unsqueeze(0))
       fig = po.imshow(angle_w.unsqueeze(0))
       plt.show()

    If you wish to get the windows as shown in Supplementary Figure 1C
    in the paper [1]_, use ``torch.einsum`` (if you wish to apply these
    to images, use the ``PoolingWindows`` class instead, which has many
    more features):

       # we ignore the last ring of eccentricity windows here because
       # they're all relatively small, which makes the following plot

def normalize_windows(angle_windows, ecc_windows, window_eccentricity, scale=0):
    r"""normalize windows to have L1-norm of 1

    we calculate the L1-norm of single windows (that is, product of
    eccentricity and angular windows) for all angles, one middling
    eccentricity (third of the way thorugh), then average across angles
    (because of alignment with pixel grid, L1-norm will vary somewhat
    across angles).

    L1-norm scales linearly with area, which is proportional to the width in
    the angular direction times the width in the radial direction. The angular
    width grows linearly with eccentricity, while the radial width grows with
    the reciprocal of the derivative of our scaling function (that's log(ecc)
    for gaussian windows). so we use that product to scale it for the different
    windows. only eccentricity windows is normalized (don't need to divide
    both).

    Parameters
    ----------
    angle_windows : dict
        dictionary containing the angular windows
    ecc_windows : dict
        dictionary containing the eccentricity windows
    window_eccentricity : array_like
        array containing the eccentricity for each window that defines
        their location relative to each other (and so can be in either
        pixels or degrees). this is used to determine how to scale the
        L1-norm. It should probably be the central eccentricity, but it
        should not contain any zeros.
    scale : int, optional
        which scale to calculate norm for and modify

    Returns
    -------
    ecc_windows : dict
        the normalized ecc_windows. only ``scale`` is modified
    scale_factor : torch.Tensor
        the scale_factor used to normalize eccentricity windows at this
        scale (as a 3d tensor, number of eccentricity windows by 1 by
        1). stored by ``PoolingWindows`` object so we can undo it for
        ``project()`` or plotting purposes
